    <h1>Week 1: C++ Basics</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Task: Create a simple bank system to keep track of account balances.</p>
    <p>Purpose: Learn how to declare variables, handle input and output, and loops.</p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>These instructions are designed to help you break your programming into
      small pieces to make it easier for you to write and debug. You only turn
      in the final program, after all of the parts have been written, but it
      will be easier if you make sure that each part is complete before
      proceeding to the next.</p>
    <p>Before attempting to complete the task, you should read through the following material.
      These reading links are provided to help you understand what you'll need to do as you
      complete the task. You don't necessarily need to read every word of each link, but you
      should browse through each link and spend time on concepts that are not familiar to you.

    <p>You may need to consult additional documentation not listed here. You
      should ask for help in our class discussion when you get stuck.</p>
    <p>Each week's programming task will build upon the previous week's task, so
      it's very important to complete each task in a timely fashion. Each week, you
      should create a new project for the week's task and copy any code over from
      the previous week's project. When you submit your program code, submit all of
      your files together in a single zip file.
      <h3>Part 1.</h3>
      <p>Create a new C++ project in your IDE. If given the choice, it should be a console
        application.</p>
      <p> In your <code class="inline">main</code> function, declare three variables. The first
        will be
        an identification number of type <code class="inline">int</code>, which should be set to
        0.
        The second will be a string that represents the name of the bank account
        holder. The third will be a floating point number that represents the balance
        in the bank account.</p>
      <p>Next, prompt the user to enter the name on the account and the initial account balance.
      </p>
      <p> Run your program and it should look something like this (user input is underlined).
        <code class="console"> Enter the name: <u>George</u><br>
          Enter the balance: <u>120.50</u><br>
        </code>
      </p>
      <h3>Part 2.</h3>
      <p>Create a loop inside your <code class="inline">main</code> function. Use the loop to
        display a menu of options to the user. The menu should have two options. Option 0 is to
        quit the program and option 1 is to display the account information.</p>
      <p>The menu should be presented to the user and allow the user to enter a choice. The program should not exit until the user chooses that option from the menu.</p>
      <p>Add an option in your menu to display the account information. Use <code
        class="inline">std::cout</code> and the
      <code class="inline">&lt;&lt;</code> operator to display this information.</p>
      <p> <code class="console"> Enter the name: <u>George</u><br>
          Enter the balance: <u>120.50</u><br>
          <br>
          Account Menu:<br>
          0. Quit Program<br>
          1. Display Account Information<br>
          Your choice: <u>1</u><br>
          Account ID: 0&nbsp; Name: George&nbsp; Balance: $120.50 <br>
          Your choice: <u>0</u><br>
        </code>
      </p>
      <h3>Part 3.</h3>
      <p>Add an option in your menu to add a deposit to the account. Ask the user for the amount
        to deposit, and read in the amount. Add the new amount to the existing balance.</p>
      <h3>Part 4.</h3>
      <p>Add an option in your menu to make a withdrawal from the account. Ask the user for the
        amount
        to withdraw, and read in the amount. Subtract the new amount to the existing balance.
      </p>
      <p> Example input and output (input is underlined):&nbsp; </p>
      <p> <code class="console"> Enter the name: <u>George</u><br>
          Enter the balance: <u>100</u><br>
