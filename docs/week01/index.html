    <h1>The Why of C++</h1>
    <h3>Some Background</h3>
    <p>Before and during the early 1970's, it was common to write operating systems in <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language" target="_blank">assembly</a>,
        a low-level programming language. The first implementation of the Unix operating system
        was written in assembly to run on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-7"
            target="_blank">PDP-7</a> computer and later
        was ported, by modifying the original assembly code, to the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11" target="_blank">PDP-11</a>. Since
        writing and porting assembly for larger systems is difficult, first Ken Thompson
        and later Dennis Richie decided to create languages to make this process easier.
        Thompson created the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)" target="_blank">B</a>
        language that Richie used as a starting point when creating the earliest versions of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#Early_developments"
            target="_blank">C</a>. By the end of 1973, the Unix kernel had been rewritten
        completely in C, making it easier to port to new versions of hardware.</p>
    <p>C, then, was a language designed for writing operating systems, device drivers, and other
        types of systems. The patterns you use when you write C are those you would
        use if you were writing code for the PDP-11. Thankfully, the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_C_Compiler" target="_blank">portable C
            compiler</a>
        led the way to making C available on multiple hardware systems that don't follow the
        PDP-11 hardware patterns while <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3212479"
            target="_blank">maintaining the PDP-11 coding patterns</a>. Porting Unix is not an
        insignificant
        task. In spite of this, the C language has made several flavors of Unix such as Solaris,
        MacOS, HP-UX, the BSD variants, and AIX possible.
        Linux, a Unix-like system, is also written in C.</p>
    <p>In the late 1970's, <a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/hopl2.pdf" target="_blank">Bjarne
            Stroustrup</a> was a graduate student. He had been using a language called Simula to
        simulate parallel data flow in
        computing systems. Among other things, Bjarne liked the way Simula allowed related
        functions to be grouped together into classes, and that these classes could inherit
        properties
        and functionality from base classes. Unfortunately for Bjarne, the Simula language had
        drawbacks, as any language does; Simula struggled to scale.
        It ran too large and too slow for Bjarne's project. Facing the collapse of his project,
        Bjarne switched languages to BCPL, a language he said was horrible.
        As to how easy BCPL was to use, Bjarne said, "BCPL makes C look like a very high-level
        language."
    </p>
    <p>
        After leaving the university with his PHD, Bjarne continued working on the problem he
        had faced. He eventually created C with Objects, and then
        C++. His goal was to create a language that allowed the organizational goodies he liked
        from Simula, while still being able to scale like C.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested in a career using C++, or just want to know it in depth,
        Stroustrup's seminal book, The C++ Programming Language, <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-hardcover-4th/dp/0321958322/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=c%2B%2B+programming+language&qid=1600365132&sr=8-3"
            target="_blank">is available
            in hardback, paperback and electronically</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Python and C++ are Related</h3>
    <p>Take a look at Figure 1. It shows the ancestry of both C++ and Python. Since C is an
        ancestor of both C++ and Python you can expect to see some
        things in C++ that remind you of what you learned about coding in Python. C is not
        Python's only ancestor. A very strong contributor to Python
        is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula" target="_blank">Modula
            language</a>. Because of this ancestry, modules exist in Python that are somewhat
        similar to classes in C++. Since Modula is not an ancestor of C++, C++ has no concept of
        a range and, as you will see, the syntax
        and structure of for loops is different from what you learned for Python though the loop
        concepts remain the same.</p>

            target="_blank">Stroustrup's paper</a> on the subject, written in 2002. There,
        students will learn, among other things, that C++ is not a superset of C. The article
        does not, however, include changes made to both languages since 2002.</p>

    <h1>Installations</h1>
    <h2>The IDE</h2>
    <br />
    <h3>Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition (Windows)</h3>
    <section class="callout">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Windows users should install <a
                href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/">Visual Studio
                <em>Community</em></a>, NOT Visual Studio <em>Code</em>. These are two vastly
            different products. Visual Studio <em>Code</em> is a nice text editor with great
            extensions, but it is not the right tool for professional C++ development. Visual
            Studio <em>Community</em> is a full-featured IDE (Integrated Development
            Environment), including a modern C++ compiler and debugger. Both of these products
            from Microsoft are free. For this class, make sure you are using Visual Studio
            <em>Community</em>.</p>
    </section>
    <p>If it isn't already installed on your machine, start by downloading and installing
        <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/" target="_blank">
            Visual Studio
            Community Edition</a>. This is NOT the same thing as Visual Studio Code.</p>
    <p>Next, watch and follow the steps in 
        the video <a href="https://youtu.be/IsAoIqnNia4" target="_blank">How to Install Visual
            Studio 2019 for C++ Programming</a> to see how to complete the download, create your
        first project, and then run it.
    </p>

    <h3>Xcode (MacOS)</h3>
    <p>If it isn't already installed on your machine, go to the
        <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12" target="_blank">Apple
            app store download page for Xcode</a>. When you attempt to install, if you don't
        have the latest
        version of MacOS, you may see a message saying you don't have a compatible MacOS
        version. If you see this message, update your OS to
        the latest version.</p>
    <p>Follow the video tutorial <a href="https://youtu.be/HA-NahwEnyA" target="_blank">Compile
            C++ Using Xcode</a> to see how to create, compile, and run a C++ project
        after launching Xcode.</p>

    <h3>Eclipse (Windows, MacOS, Linux)</h3>
    <p>Eclipse is a good cross-platform development environment. Eclipse can be
    <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/ide/"> downloaded from the website</a>.
    Note that Eclipse does not come with a compiler, so that will have to be
    downloaded and installed separately. On Windows, you can download either
    the original <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/">MinGW</a> or
    the newer <a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/">MinGW-w64</a> project. On
    MacOS, you should use the clang compiler and lldb debugger because they are
    natively supported (however, as of this writing they may not work well with
    Eclipse).  You will need to install them using Xcode. On Linux, you should
    just use the native gcc compiler. The gcc compiler should be available to
    download the normal way you install software for your Linux distribution.
    This course provides some videos to help you get started with Eclipse.


    <h2>Workflow</h2>
    <p>It is important for you to remember that you will want to make a DIFFERENT project for
        each task you are given. Do NOT create a single project
        and think you can reuse it for all of your tasks. If you try this, you will regret it.
        Instead, create a directory into which you can save
        all of your projects. That way you know where to look when you want to find an old
        project.
    </p>

    <p>The work you do using these two tools will flow like this. Each time you are asked to do
        a task, create a directory named for the task. For example,
        if you were asked for your task to write code that calculated loan payments, you could
        create a project called loan_pay_calc.
        Each file you create for this task will be part of this project.</p>
    <p>If you follow this pattern for each assignment, you will reduce your workload.</p>
    <p>Do NOT create one project for the course and think that you can put the code for all of
        your tasks in it. If you ignore this advice and do this
        anyway, your life will be harder, completing your tasks will take longer, and your code
        will be harder to understand. You don't need these
        self-inflicted barriers to your learning.<br><br>So please, make a separate project for
        each task!
