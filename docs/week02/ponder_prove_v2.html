    <h1>Week 2: Using Classes</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Task: Create a simple bank system to keep track of account balances.</p>
    <p>Purpose: Learn how to create C++ classes and use overloaded operators.</p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>These instructions are designed to help you break your programming into
      small pieces to make it easier for you to write and debug. You only turn
      in the final program, after all of the parts have been written, but it
      will be easier if you make sure that each part is complete before
      proceeding to the next.</p>
    <p>Before attempting to complete the task, you should read through the following material.
      These reading links are provided to help you understand what you'll need to do as you
      complete the task. You don't necessarily need to read every word of each link, but you
      should browse through each link and spend time on concepts that are not familiar to you.

    <p>You may need to consult additional documentation not listed here. You should ask for help
      in our class discussion when
      you get stuck.</p>
    <p> <b>As you write your program code, you will separate your code into different
        files.</b>
      <p>You should create the following files:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code class="inline">account.h</code> - Stores the Account class declaration.</li>
        <li><code class="inline">account.cpp</code> - Stores the Account class implementation.
        </li>
        <li><code class="inline">program.cpp</code> - Contains the main function.</li>
      </ul>
      You will create header files and cpp source files for each class.
      You will place the class declaration in a header file, and your class
      method implementations will go in a cpp source file. Your main function
      will go in yet another cpp source file. All of your cpp source files will
      #include the header file for your class. Do not #include cpp files from
      another cpp file. You should add each source file to the project in your
      development environment.
    </p>

    <p><b>Hint:</b> The section called "The Date Class" in the <a
        href="../week03/index.html">Defining and Using Classes</a>
      document will be helpful to determine how to separate your code. This document has an
      example of which things go in the class header file and which things go in the cpp
      implementation file.</p>
    <p> This task
      will build upon last week's programming task. However, you should
      still create a new project for this week's task and copy last week's
      code into your new project. When you submit your program
      code, submit all of your files together in a single zip file. </p>
    <h3>Part 1.</h3>
    <p> Create a simple class that represents a bank account. For this task,
      you will create a program that has a single account. In later tasks, you
      will add the ability to store multiple accounts.</p>
    <p> The account class will have the following data members:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>an account ID (integer)</li>
      <li>account name (string)</li>
      <li>account balance (float)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of
      these members should be private or protected. (This is generally true
      of all class data members.)</p>
    <p>The account class will have a constructor that takes no parameters.
      This constructor will initialize the data members to empty values.</p>
    <!-- <p> The account class will have a copy constructor that copies all of the
        data from one instance to another instance. The source instance should
        be passed by reference.</p>
      <p> The account class will have a destructor that takes no parameters and
        an empty body. We'll add more code here later.</p> -->
    <p>The account class will have a method that prompts the user to enter
      the name and the initial balance. The ID of the object will be
      automatically set by your program with the next ID number available. The
      first ID number is zero, and subsequent accounts will get numerically
      increasing ID numbers. A static data member is one way to store the next
      available ID number (this is separate from the ID data member in each
      object).</p>
    <!-- <p> The account class will have a method that will send the data members
        to an output stream. The output stream to use is passed in as a parameter. 
        The output stream should be passed by reference.</p> -->
    <p> The account class will have a method that will display the account information.</p>
    <p> Your main function will create an object of the account class, call the
      object's input method that asks the user to enter the account
      information, and call the object's output method to show the account information to the
      user. </p>
    <!-- <p>You can use the standard object <tt>std::cout</tt> to pass to
          the output method.</p> -->
    <p> Example input and output (input is underlined):</p>
    <p> <code class="console"> Enter the name: <u>George</u><br>
        Enter the balance: <u>100</u><br>
        Account ID: 0&nbsp; Name: George&nbsp; Balance: $100.00</code></p>
    <br>
    <h3>Part 2.</h3>
    <!-- <p> Write an output operator <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> to enable writing the object's data
        members to an output stream. Since you should already have a public
        method that can be used to write an object's information to an output
        stream (see Part 1 above), you merely need to call it from your output
        operator.&nbsp; Output operators take an output stream reference as
        the first parameter, and a const reference of the class as the second
        parameter. This operator returns the stream reference, which is what
        allows these calls to be chained together. The output operator should
        not be defined as a member of your class; instead, it is defined as a
        standalone function in the same file as the rest of your class methods.
        A function prototype for this function should be placed in the class
        header file below the class definition.</p>
      <p> Modify your main function to use the output operator instead of
        calling the output method directly, to send the object to <tt>std::cout</tt>.</p>
      <p> Example input and output (input is underlined):</p>
      <p> <code class="console"> Enter the name: <u>George</u><br>
          Enter the balance: <u>100</u><br>
          Account ID: 0&nbsp; Name: George&nbsp; Balance: $100.00<br>
        </code> </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Part 3.</h3> -->
    <p>Add a menu to your program to allow the user to manipulate and view the
      account information. Your menu should have two options: display the
      account information and quit the program. The code that displays the menu
      options and reads the user selection should be inside a loop in your main
      function. This way the user can interact with the program repeatedly until
      finished.</p>
    <p>Example input and output (input is underlined):</p>
    <code class="console"> Enter the name: <u>George</u><br>
      Enter the balance: <u>100</u><br>
      <br>
      Account Menu:<br>
      0. Quit Program<br>
      1. Display Account Information<br>
      Your choice: <u>1</u><br>
      Account ID: 0 Name: George Balance: $100.00<br>
      <br>
      Account Menu:<br>
      0. Quit Program<br>
      1. Display Account Information<br>
      Your choice: <u>0</u><br>
    </code> <br>
    <h3> Part 3. </h3>
    <p>Add a method to your Account class that will add a deposit to the account balance. This
      method should accept a <code class="inline">float</code> and return nothing.</p>
    <!-- <p> Add a new operator += to the class that will add a deposit to the
        account balance. This operator should take a <code class="inline">float</code> as a parameter and return a reference to an Account.</p>
        <p>As an example, the declaration of this operator in the header file should look something like this:</p> 
        <code>Account& operator+= (float deposit);</code>

        <p>The implementation of this operator in the cpp file should look something like this:</p>
        
        <pre><code>
Account& Account::operator+= (float deposit) {
    balance += deposit;
    return *this;
}</code></pre> -->

    <p>Add a new menu selection to allow the user to add a
      deposit to the account. </p>

    <p> Example input and output (input is underlined): </p>
    <code class="console"> Enter the name: <u>George</u><br>
      Enter the balance: <u>100</u><br>
      <br>
      Account Menu:<br>
      0. Quit Program<br>
      1. Display Account Information<br>
      2. Add a deposit to an account<br>
      Your choice: <u>2</u><br>
      Amount to deposit: <u>15</u><br>
      <br>
      Account Menu:<br>
      0. Quit Program<br>
      1. Display Account Information<br>
      2. Add a deposit to an account<br>
      Your choice: <u>1</u><br>
      Account ID: 0&nbsp; Name: George&nbsp; Balance: $115.00<br>
    </code> <br>
    <h3> Part 4. </h3>
    <p>Add a method to your Account class that will subtract a withdrawal amount from the
      account balance. This method should accept a <code class="inline">float</code> and return
      nothing.</p>
    <!-- <p> Add a new operator -= to the class that will subtract a withdrawal
        from the account balance. Add a new menu selection to allow the user to
        make a withdrawal from the account. </p> -->
    <p> Example input and output (input is underlined):&nbsp; </p>
    <p> <code class="console"> Enter the name: <u>George</u><br>
        Enter the balance: <u>100</u><br>
        <br>
        Account Menu:<br>
        0. Quit Program<br>
        1. Display Account Information<br>
        2. Add a deposit to an account<br>
        3. Withdraw from an account<br>
        Your choice: <u>3</u><br>
        Amount to withdraw: <u>15</u><br>
        <br>
        Account Menu:<br>
        0. Quit Program<br>

        Your choice: <u>1</u><br>
        Account ID: 0&nbsp; Name: George&nbsp; Balance: $85.00 </code> </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3> Part 5. Optional for extra learning and practice. </h3>
    <p>As an optional enhancement to your program, implement one or more of the following. <b>
        These
        are all optional and are not required to complete this task.
      </b> </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p> Add an add-onto operator += to the Account class that will add a deposit to the
          account balance. This operator should take a <code class="inline">float</code> as a
          parameter and return a reference to an Account.</p>
        <p>The declaration of this operator in the header file should look
          something like this:</p>
        <code>Account& operator+= (float deposit);</code>
        <p>If properly implemented, now you can add a deposit to the account by doing this: </p>
        <pre><code>my_account += deposit_amount;</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add a subtract-from operator -= to the class that will subtract a withdrawal
          from the account balance. </p>
        <p>If properly implemented, now you can subtract a withdrawal from the account by doing this: </p>
        <pre><code>my_account -= withdrawal_amount;</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add a method to the Account class that takes an output stream as a parameter and
          returns an output stream. The declaration of this method in your header file should
          look something like this:</p>
        <code>std::ostream& display(std::ostream& out) const;</code>
        <p>You can use the standard object <code class="inline">std::cout</code> to pass to
          this output method.</p>
          <p>If properly implemented, now you can display the account information by passing an output stream to the display method, like this: </p>
        <pre><code>my_account.display(std::cout);</code></pre>
        <p>This is helpful because we can now provide different output streams, such as a file output stream, rather than being limited to displaying account information only in the console using <code class="inline">std::cout</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add an insertion operator (<code class="inline">&lt;&lt;</code>) to enable
          writing the object's data members to an output stream. Because this operator is
          defined outside the class, it cannot access <code class="inline">private</code> or
          <code class="inline">protected</code> members. You will need to use a public
          method that can be used to write an object's information to an output
          stream (see optional item number 3 above). Then, you merely need to call it from your
          insertion operator. Insertion operators take an output stream reference as
          the first parameter, and a const reference of the class as the second
          parameter. This operator returns the output stream reference, which is what
          allows these calls to be chained together. The insertion operator should
          not be defined as a member of your class; instead, it is defined as a
          standalone function in the same file as the rest of your class methods.
          A function prototype for this function should be placed in the class
          header file below the class definition.</p>
        <p> Modify your main function to use the output operator instead of
          calling the output method directly, to send the object to <code
            class="inline">std::cout</code>.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre><code>Account my_account; // Create an account
my_account.initialize(); // Prompts user for name and account balance

my_account.display(); // Default method to display account information

my_account.display(std::cout); // Using the optional number 3 method

std::cout &lt;&lt; my_account; // Do this instead after implementing the &lt;&lt; operator
              </code>
            </pre>

      </li>

    </ol>
