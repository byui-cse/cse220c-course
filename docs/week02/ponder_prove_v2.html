      <h1>Week 2: Using Classes</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Task: Create a simple bank system to keep track of account balances.</p>
      <p>Purpose: Learn how to create C++ classes and use overloaded operators.</p>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>These instructions are designed to help you break your programming into
        small pieces to make it easier for you to write and debug. You only turn
        in the final program, after all of the parts have been written, but it
        will be easier if you make sure that each part is complete before
        proceeding to the next.</p>

       <p>You may need to consult additional documentation not listed here. You should ask for help in our class discussion when
         you get stuck.</p>
      <p> As you write your program code, you will separate your code into different
        files. You will create header files and cpp source files for each class.
        You will place the class declaration in a header file, and your class
        method implementations will go in a cpp source file. Your main function
        will go in yet another cpp source file. All of your cpp source files will
        include your header files as needed. This task
        will build upon last week's programming task.  However, you should
        still create a new project for this week's task and copy last week's
        code into your new project. When you submit your program
        code, submit all of your files together in a single zip file. </p>
      <h3>Part 1.</h3>
      <p> Create a simple class that represents a bank account. For this task,
        you will create a program that has a single account. In later tasks, you
        will add the ability to store multiple accounts.</p>
      <p> The account class will have the following data members:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>an account ID (integer)</li>
       <li>account name (string)</li>
       <li>account balance (float)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of
        these members should be private or protected. (This is generally true
        of all class data members.)</p>
      <p> The account class will have a constructor that takes no parameters.
        This constructor will initialize the data members to empty values.</p>
      <p> The account class will have a copy constructor that copies all of the
        data from one instance to another instance. The source instance should
        be passed by reference.</p>
      <p> The account class will have a destructor that takes no parameters and
        an empty body. We'll add more code here later.</p>
      <p> The account class will have a method that prompts the user to enter
        the name and the initial balance. The ID of the object will be
        automatically set by your program with the next ID number available. The
        first ID number is 0, and subsequent accounts will get numerically
        increasing ID numbers.</p>
      <p> The account class will have a method that will send the data members
        to the output stream passed in as a parameter. The stream should be
        passed by reference to the method, and should return the same stream
        reference that is passed to the method.</p>
      <p> Your main function will create an object of the account class, call the
        object's input method that asks the user to enter the account
        information, and call the object's output method to show the data
        members to the user. You can use the standard object <tt>std::cout</tt> to pass to
        the output method.</p>
      <p> Example input and output (input is underlined):</p>
      <p> <code class="console"> Enter the name: <u>George</u><br>
          Enter the balance: <u>100</u><br>
          Account ID: 0&nbsp; Name: George&nbsp; Balance: $100.00</code></p>
      <br>
      <h3>Part 2.</h3>
      <p> Write an output operator <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> to enable writing the object's data
        members to an output stream. Since you should already have a public
        method that can be used to write an object's information to an output
        stream (see part 1 above), you merely need to call it from your output
        operator.&nbsp; Output operators take the output stream reference as
        the first parameter, and a const reference of the class as the second
        parameter. This operator returns the stream reference, which is what
        allows these calls to be chained together.</p>
      <p> Modify your main function to use the output operator instead of
        calling the output method directly, to send the object to <tt>std::cout</tt>.</p>
      <p> Example input and output (input is underlined):</p>
      <p> <code class="console"> Enter the name: <u>George</u><br>
          Enter the balance: <u>100</u><br>
          Account ID: 0&nbsp; Name: George&nbsp; Balance: $100.00<br>
        </code> </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Part 3.</h3>
      <p>Add a menu to your program to allow the user to manipulate and view the
        account information. Your menu should have two options: display the
        account information and quit the program.</p>
      <p>Example input and output (input is underlined):</p>
      <code class="console"> Enter the name: <u>George</u><br>
        Enter the balance: <u>100</u><br>
        <br>
        Account Menu:<br>
        0. Quit Program<br>
        1. Display Account Information<br>
        Your choice: <u>1</u><br>
        Account ID: 0 Name: George Balance: $100.00<br>
        <br>
        Account Menu:<br>
        0. Quit Program<br>
        1. Display Account Information<br>
        Your choice: <u>0</u><br>
      </code> <br>
      <h3> Part 4. </h3>
      <p> Add a new operator += to the class that will add a deposit to the
        account balance. Add a new menu selection to allow the user to add a
        deposit to the account. </p>
      <p> Example input and output (input is underlined): </p>
      <code class="console"> Enter the name: <u>George</u><br>
        Enter the balance: <u>100</u><br>
        <br>
        Account Menu:<br>
        0. Quit Program<br>
        1. Display Account Information<br>
        2. Add a deposit to an account<br>
        Your choice: <u>2</u><br>
        Amount to deposit: <u>15</u><br>
        <br>
        Account Menu:<br>
        0. Quit Program<br>
        1. Display Account Information<br>
        2. Add a deposit to an account<br>
        Your choice: <u>1</u><br>
        Account ID: 0&nbsp; Name: George&nbsp; Balance: $115.00<br>
      </code> <br>
      <h3> Part 5. </h3>
      <p> Add a new operator -= to the class that will subtract a withdrawal
        from the account balance. Add a new menu selection to allow the user to
        make a withdrawal from the account. </p>
      <p> Example input and output (input is underlined):&nbsp; </p>
      <p> <code class="console"> Enter the name: <u>George</u><br>
          Enter the balance: <u>100</u><br>
          <br>
          Account Menu:<br>
          0. Quit Program<br>
          1. Display Account Information<br>
          2. Add a deposit to an account<br>
          3. Withdraw from an account<br>
          Your choice: <u>3</u><br>
          Amount to withdraw: <u>15</u><br>
          <br>
          Account Menu:<br>
          0. Quit Program<br>
          1. Display Account Information<br>
          2. Add a deposit to an account<br>
          3. Withdraw from an account<br>
          Your choice: <u>1</u><br>
          Account ID: 0&nbsp; Name: George&nbsp; Balance: $85.00 </code> </p>
