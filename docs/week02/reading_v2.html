<h2>Classes</h2>

<p>This section is still under construction. Please refer to the links in the
task description for more information about declaring and using classes. Once
you have finished looking over those documents, come back here for the rest of
the story.</p>

<h3>Static class members</h3>

<p>
Normally, there is one copy of each data member for each object declared of a class. This means that
each object is distinct and separate from every other object, and changing one object's data member does
not change any other object's data member. However, sometimes we want to share a data member among
all instances of a particular class. We can do this using the <tt>static</tt> keyword. Declaring a <tt>static</tt>
member is like declaring a global variable that can only be used by the class members. Declaring
<tt>static</tt> members is preferable to global variables.
</p>

<p>
When a class declares <tt>static</tt> variables, they must be defined somewhere
also exactly one time. A good place to do this is in the cpp file for the
class. Static data members should not be initialized in constructors, but are rather
initialized the same way as global variables. Don't forget to use the class name and the
scope operator <tt>::</tt>, the same as other class members.</p>

<code><pre>
// Define Widget Class -- this part goes in a header file
class Widget {
protected:
  int value;
  static int next_id;  // Only one instance of next_id exists, regardless of the number of existing Widgets
}

// Instantiate Widget Class static variables -- this part goes in a cpp file
int Widget::next_id = 0;
</pre></code>

<p></p>

<h3>The <tt>const</tt> keyword</h3>

<p>
In C++, we want to ensure data integrity. This means that we want to be able to make sure
that a particular object or function parameter does not change in a specific function. We can do this 
with the <tt>const</tt> keyword. Consider this class:
</p>

<code><pre>
class Widget {
protected:
  int value;

public:
  int get_value(void) const;

};
</pre></code>

<p>
We want to make sure that the <tt>get_value</tt> method on the <tt>Widget</tt> class does not change the <tt>Widget</tt> object, 
so we put <tt>const</tt> on the function after the function's parameters. We need to put the <tt>const</tt> keyword again when we define
the function in our cpp file:
</p>

<code><pre>

int Widget::get_value(void) const
{
    return value;
}
</pre></code>

<p>
We can also use <tt>const</tt> with function parameters. When doing this, we ensure that the parameter will not be modified in 
that function. <tt>const</tt> is often used with references to ensure that the object doesn't change and will not be copied (because
copying objects can be a time-consuming activity that is usually made unnecessary by using <tt>const</tt>).
</p>

<code><pre>
int some_function(const Widget&amp; w)    // type is "Constant Widget Reference"
{
    // ...
}
</pre></code>
