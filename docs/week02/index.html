	<h3>Shared Operators</h3>
	<p>Remember, Python has C as one of its ancestors. Because of this, it is not shocking to find out that they share many of the same
		operators. These include +, -, /, *, ==, !=, &lt, &gt, etc. By going to these two sites, you can compare 
		<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm">Python's list of operators</a> to 
		<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/operators/">C++'s list of operators</a>. When you do so, 
		you will find that Python has a few that C++ does not.</p>
	<h3>C++'s missing operators</h3>
	<p>Because Python was created after C++, its developers were able to add operators they had seen in other languages that made sense, to them, to include
	in Python. These are the ones you should not expect to find in C++:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>** - the exponentiation operator</li>
		<li>// - the floor division operator</li>
		<li>&lt&gt - an alternative to !=</li>
		<li>**= - the exponent and assign operator</li>
		<li>and - the logical and operator</li>
		<li>or - the locical or operator</li>
		<li>not - the logical not operator</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Don't get the wrong idea. Each of these behaviors can be done in C, they will just be done a little differently. Take a look
	at Table 1 to see how.</p>

	<h3>Variables</h3>
	<p>In Python, a variable can hold any type of value and can change the type of value it holds. For example, this code is valid in Python.</p>
	<pre>
<code class="Python">age = 3
age = 5
age = 4.2</code>
	</pre>
	<p>C++ treats its variables differently. In C++ you not only declare the variable name, but must also either declare the type of data the variable can hold 
		or let the compiler auto-detect the type, in CS speak this is called 'type inference', or declare the type specifically.
	This is a valid C++ variable declaration that can hold an integer and one that can hold a double.</p>
	<pre>
<code>int age = 3;
auto height = 1.7;</code>
	</pre>
	While this is valid C++ code
	<pre>
<code>int age = 3;
age = 5;
auto height = 1.7;
height = 1.0;
</code>
	</pre>
	this is not valid.
	<pre>
<code>int age = 3;
age = 4.2;
auto height = 1.7;
height = "bob";</code>
	</pre>
	<p>As with all things, there are pluses and minuses of requiring the type of a varable to be unchangable. One minus is that you may need to declare 
	more variables. One plus is that there is no chance that the type of data in a variable will change when the code is running. There is a common 
	logic bug in all languages that allow the type of data in variables to change. The programmer forgets that the data type has changed, performs a
	calculation, and then gets strange, unexpected results. This type of logic error can't happen in C++ since this type of invalid code would fail to compile.</p>
	<h4>Some Common, Valid, C++ Variable Types</h4>
	<p>Basic Integer Types
	<ul>
		<li>short</li>
		<li>int</li>
		<li>long</li>

	</ul></p>
	<p>Basic Floating Point Types
		<ul>
			<li>float</li>
			<li>double</li>
			<li>long double</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Boolean Types
		<ul>
			<li>bool</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Character Types
		<ul>
			<li>char - single character</li>
			<li>std::string - strings of characters</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Be careful. It is tempting to think, "Hey...those doubles look like they could hold bigger integers than long can. Maybe I'll just use them." Such a thought would lead you 
	down a path you do not want to be on. Beginning programmers tend to think of floating point numbers as being a coninuous number line. They are not. There are 
	numbers that a double can not represent. There are gaps in the floating point numbers on all computers in all languages and the larger the integer you 
	try to represent, the higher the probability that adding 1 to that number will result in the original number. This also applies floating point numbers when using 
	variables of type double, not just integers.</p>

	<h3>Pointers, Groups, and Flow</h3>
	<p>If there is one concept in C++ you have heard about, it's probably pointers. Pointers have an undeserved reputation for being difficult. 
	In fact, pointers are like your mother.</p>
	<p>As a teenager, maybe you had a sibling that was an absolute slob...or maybe you WERE the slob.&#x1F61C; Either way, if you had a shared room, this interaction 
		had a high probability of happening. Let's assume you were the slob just to make things easier. Early one morning, somewhere around 10:30 or 11:00, your sibling 
		walks into the room, picks up the pile of 'only slightly used' clothes next to your bed, dumps them on you and says, "Here's your dirty clothes!" They then 'rudely' 
		walk back out of the room.
	</p>
	<p>A mother, or at least my mother, took a different approach. She'd look at me, point at the clothes and say, "There are your dirty clothes." You see, 
		she was pointing to the clothes and I was the one who was needing to act. She was a 'dirty clothes pointer.' She was NOT the dirty clothes. There is a 
		difference.
	</p>
	<p>That's all pointers do, point at something.</p>
	<p>Now pointers are not a new type of variable in C++. They are a modified type. As you know, this is the declaration of a string.</p>

	<p><pre><code class="C++">string name = "Bob"</code>
	</pre></p>

	<p>To declar a pointer, the * character is placed next to the type to modify it so it is a pointer. If a C++ variable is set to point at 
		nothing, the key word to use is NULL. This is similar to the None keyword in Python. You can see both of these things in this example.
	</p>
	<p><pre><code class="C++">string* name = NULL;</code>
	</pre></p>
	<p>Let me translate this line of code for you. "There is a variable called name of type string pointer. Set it to point at nothing."</p>

	<h5>Generating a Pointer Value</h5>
	<p></p>
	<h4>Arrays</h4>
	<p>A common use you will have for pointers is to point at an array. </p>
	<p>Without the use of any external libraries, the C++ languages' way of collecting like things together is to use arrays. </p>
	<h4>Making Choices</h4>
	<p>The flow of computation through the code of an application is something that some new to programming 
		don't think about or think about it as if it was a static tree. It isn't static. Computation flows 
		through an application like electricity flows through circuts. Both electricity and computation flow using a path of least resistance 
		approach, much like unwise students. If it is possible for 
	</p>
