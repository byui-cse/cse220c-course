    <h1>CSE 220C: Week 03</h1>
    <p>Inside C++ Containers</p>
  </div>
</div>
	<h1>Hidden Arrays</h1>
	<p>
		Many of the standard containers, array, vector stack, queue, and so forth, are actually classes that have a private C-type array as a property. Algorithms are then turned into code, instance functions of the class, to make the use of the C-type array <strong>much</strong> safer. These methods have been tested, enhanced, fixed, and optimized for decades. That's why it is so much safer to use a standard container that wraps a C-type array than to use one directly. If you are ever tempted to use a C-type array, you should probably use the std::array instead. It adds almost no overhead.
	</p>
	<p>
		But sometimes, arrays are either too restrictive or the code to manipulate to match the need becomes way to complicated and slow. Here is an image of a structure known as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH6yxkw0u78">tree</a>.
	</p>
	<img src="images/tree.png" alt="A tree with root D, branches B and G, and leaves A, C in branch B, and E, Z in branch G">
	<p>
		Can this be represented using a C-type array? Yes. But just because you can, doesn't mean you should. When you shouldn't, that's when things like list and map come into play. They are <strong>not</strong> wrappers around a hidden C-type array. Instead they use a completely different design...nodes.
	</p>

	<h1>Nodes: (Sometimes) A Better Way</h1>
	<h3>A Node?? What is that??</h3>

	<p>
		Here is a list. It's what you are going to be reading about for a while.
	</p>
	<img src="images/list.png" alt="a list with the contents A through D">
	<p>In this image, each blue square represents a node. A node has data. Each node in the image has A, B, C, or D as its data. A node also 'knows' about other nodes via connections. These connections keep the nodes in some specific order. The connections in the image are the black lines you see connecting the nodes together.</p>
	<p>When nodes are well-designed, you can start anywhere in the list and move either direction. That means, each node has to know about the previous node, traditionally known as 'parent', and the next node traditionally known as 'child'. In the image above, the node containing B is the child of the node containing A and the node containing A is the parent of the node containing B.</p>
	<p>
		Examine the tree again.
	</p>

	<img src="images/tree.png" alt="A tree with root D, branches B and G, and leaves A, C in branch B, and E, Z in branch G">
	<p>
		In this image, each node has to 'know about' two children, traditionally called 'right child' and 'left child.' Therefore, the node containing D is the parent of the two nodes containing B and G. The parent of the node containing B is the node containing D. The parent of the node containing G is also the node containing D.
	</p>
	<p>
		Compare the list and tree images. Notice that the right-most branch of the tree, the nodes containing D, G, and Z, looks just like a list. That's because a list is just a tree with no branches.&#128512 It should, then, be possible to create a well-designed node that can be used to represent both a list and a tree. Ah...code re-use...that's a great thing! The code snippet below shows the code for a node that can hold characters and be used for lists and trees.&#128526
	</p>

	<p><pre><code class="C++">class Node{
private:
    char value;
    weak_ptr&lt;Node&gt; parent;
    shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; left_child;
    shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; right_child;
public:
    Node(char a_value);
    Node(char a_value, shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; a_parent);
    char& operator * ();
};//end of Node class
</code></pre></p>
<p>
	You will see the Node class self-references itself with pointer container classes that you will learn more about in week 5 called <i>weak_ptr</i> and <i>shared_ptr</i>. Pointers are ways to keep track of data or objects to be shared and without needing to make a copy. Think of the parent, left, and right child pointers as the linkages between different nodes of a tree. These pointer containers are also really helpful for designing safe, well maintained code, better than plain pointers that we call these "smart pointers". So we used them here to help create the Node class.
<p>
	This Node class has a constructor that has parameters for initializing <i>value</i> and the node that should be the <i>parent</i>. When the <i>parent</i> pointer is initialized in the constructor for a new Node instance, the parent can also be accessed to link the parent to the child from the parent Node. When doing this, the nodes in this tree are doubly linked from both directions.
	</p>
<p>
	Anytime a smart pointer is used or copied, the smart pointer can
track the number of copies in use. When a copy of a smart pointer is
deleted, it also takes note. When there are no copies of the smart
pointer left, and a deconstructor is called, the smart pointer and the data the
container manages can be made free. Stop for a few minutes and think
about deleting a bunch of linked nodes. Then answer the question,
&ldquo;Why is the parent pointer a
<a href="https://studiofreya.com/cpp/cpp-smart-pointers-weak_ptr/">weak_ptr</a>
instead of a shared_ptr?&rdquo; Each pointer class keeps track of its use
differently. Discuss this question and possible answers on Microsoft
Teams when preparing to work on pointers in week 5.
</p>
<p>
	A node that can hold character-type value is <strong>okay</strong>, but why can't have our class store any data we want, like a std::list as we introduced in this week's lesson? To do that, the node class has to be changed and become a node class template.</p>
<p>
	<img src="images/stop.png" alt="a stop sign"> This gets into much more detail on class templates. Go back and review <a href="data_storage.html">this week's lesson overview</a> if you haven't covered the basics on this. You don't need to master templates in this class -- it's just good to learn about what's going on!
</p>
<p>
	I'm going to show you some code here, but it isn't code in the traditional sense. What we've done is replace the <strong>char</strong> type keyword with a placeholder called <strong>T</strong>. The first line of the code snippet below tells the compiler that node is a class template, instead of a complete class, and the type placeholder is called <strong>T</strong>. The <strong>typename</strong> keyword is just used to tell the compiler that <strong>T</strong> is actually a type, not a variable. Until <strong>T</strong> is actually filled in, this code actually does nothing at all. So as you will see, turning Node into a template definition is simple when one has decided on the class framework.
</p>

	<p><pre><code class="C++">template&lt;typename T>
class Node{
private:
    T value;
    weak_ptr&lt;Node&gt; parent;
    shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; left_child;
    shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; right_child;
public:
    Node(T a_value);
    Node(T a_value, shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; a_parent);
    T& operator * ();
};//end of Node class
</code></pre></p>
<p>
	As said above, by itself a template class does nothing. It has to be used now to actually come into existance. We do that by instantiating a class template using syntax you will be familiar with in this week's lesson:<br>
<i>Node&lt;int&gt; node;</i><br>
And there you've just created a Node that stores an int. You can do the
same as before and create a Node that stores <i>&lt;char&gt;</i>. Now you have
one <i>template</i> that can cover Nodes of many types. Templates are
great ways to generate more reusable code without needing to hard code
mostly the same code again and again.
</p>
<p>
	Nodes, by themselves, are pretty useless. Below is a simplistic, naive list class template. Notice that the list class template has <strong>Node</strong> as a private, inner class. Because of this, no code anywhere else in any app can instantiate or use the encapsulated, Has_A Node class. Because the node class template is completely encapsulated, it can be made much simpler than the previous code where <strong>Node</strong> was not encapsulated. Now its instance variables can be public and its operator can be deleted. It does keep the two constructors to help make instantiating Nodes easier.
</p>
<p>
	Using this design, each instance of <strong>List</strong> can instantiate and directly manipulate a node any time the list is told to add an element, but nothing else can touch the list's nodes. This is good.</p>
	<p>&#128512 Now the node won't need any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code">boilerplate code</a> for getters, setters, operators, and the like.&#128512
</p>
<p>Compare the code for <strong>Node</strong> below with the <strong>Node</strong> code above.</p>
<p>
	There is a <strong>very</strong> important bit of code on the line right after the end of the encapsulated, Node inner class. <span class="file_name">shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; root_node;</span>. This is a private instance variable of the List class template. It is a pointer to the Node instance that is the head, beginning, of the list. By convention, we are referring to it as the root of the list. The root is equal to <strong>nullptr</strong> for an empty list.

<p>
	To add a value to an empty list, use the list's <strong>push_back</strong> instance function. You can find the code for the <strong>push_back</strong> instance function above. There you can see that each time a value is to be added to a list, a node (<strong>node_to_add</strong>) is created to encapsulate the value. Then that node is added to the list. If the list is empty, <strong>node_to_add</strong> is added to the list by setting the root node to be <strong>node_to_add</strong>. Otherwise, the last node found in the list is set as a parent and <strong>node_to_add</strong> its right child node.
</p>
<p>Below is an example of using this naive, incomplete list class template by using it to contain ints and then adding three <strong>ints</strong> to the list.
</p>
<p><pre><code class="C++">#include "list.h"

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    List&lt;int&gt; nums;
    nums.push_back(5);
    nums.push_back(7);
    nums.push_back(9);

    //make a new list that has all of the values doubled
    List&lt;int&gt; doubled = nums.map([](int an_int)-&gt;int{
        return an_int*2;
    });

    return 0;
}
